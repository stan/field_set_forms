Field Set Forms
========

A simple plugin that makes forms so much easier to deal with.

  * Automatically marks fields as required (based on validates_presence_of ala validation_reflection, included)
  * Humanizes and titlizes labels based on ActiveRecord column names (first_name becomes 'First Name')
  * Automatically styles fields with errors and includes error messages in-line
  * Comes with a clean and simple style out of the box (so you can install hit the ground running or modify if you like)
  * Global reassignment of the required mark (defaults to *, but you can make it anything, even an image)



Customize the Required Marker
=======

If you don't like the default * you can easily override the required marker.  Just add to your environment.rb:

  FieldSetFormBuilder::REQUIRED_MARK = ' (*)'    
  
      or
    
  FieldSetFormBuilder::REQUIRED_MARK = "<img src='/images/require-bullet.png' />"  # use image instead of string-character   



Customize a Fieldset's Lable
=======

If you don't like the outcome the humanization of labels you can override them:

  <%= f.text_field :with_a_reallyugly_column_name, :label => 'Ugly column' %>
  
If you do not wish to have a column be titleized you can do:

  <%= f.text_field :do_you_want_doughnuts, :titleize => false %>
