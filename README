Field Set Forms
========

A simple plugin that makes forms so much easier to deal with.

  * Automatically marks fields as required (based on validates_presence_of ala validation_reflection, included)
  * Humanizes and titleizes labels based on column names (first_name becomes 'First Name')
  * Includes error messages in-line
  * Comes with a clean and simple style out of the box (so you can install hit the ground running)
  * Global reassignment of the required mark (defaults to *, but you can make it anything, even an image)


Using in Rails
=======

Example model:

    class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_presence_of :last_name, :date_of_birth, :email
    end

Example fieldset_form_for:

    <% fieldset_form_for @contact do |f| %>
        <%= f.text_field :first_name %>
        <%= f.text_field :last_name %>
        <%= f.text_field :email, :label => 'E-mail' %>
        <%= f.text_field :date_of_birth, :titleize => false %>
        <%= f.submit 'Create' %>
    <% end %>

Creates a form that will look roughly like:

    First Name
    [_______________________]
    Last Name *
    [_______________________]
    E-mail *
    [_______________________]
    Date of birth *
    [_______________________]
  
    (Create)


Out of Box Style Sheet
========

If you want to get up and running quickly you can use the included style sheet 'fieldset_forms.css'
and simply include it into your layout:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'fieldset_forms' %>

    

Customize the Required Marker
=======

If you don't like the default * you can easily override the required marker.  Just add to your environment.rb:

  FieldSetFormBuilder::REQUIRED_MARK = ' (*)'    
  
      or
    
  FieldSetFormBuilder::REQUIRED_MARK = "<img src='/images/require-bullet.png' />"  # use image instead of string-character   



Customized Lables
=======

If you don't like the outcome the humanization of labels you can override them:

    <%= f.text_field :with_a_reallyugly_column_name, :label => 'Ugly column' %>
  
If you do not wish to have a label be titleized you can do:

    <%= f.text_field :do_you_want_doughnuts, :titleize => false %>
